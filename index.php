                    <h4>the Untold</h4>
                    <article class="articleMedium">I’ve been wondering for more than 4 months on the silence of my heart for the future to say a few words to me. But I am left with “acceptance is hard” rule to follow. I’ve been trying for what to do next and with what confidence I am left with, I see some glasses empty even when they are filled by half.

I wouldn’t be just considering myself as the writer of this blog but maybe I am considering some of us with the same thought. When such a situation occurs we come to chose the right wrong without even considering the fact whether its right or wrong. I wanted some change in my life to just restart the whole thing, I wished for some reset button that could just refresh my memories only with the good ones and not a bad one anymore. But that’s quite impossible for now. One of my friends asked me to move to a place, a cold one instead just for fun and a changeover, I accepted the invitation without considering any fact. “Fun”...
